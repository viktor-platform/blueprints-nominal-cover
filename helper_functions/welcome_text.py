OVERVIEW = (
    "# Nominal concrete cover\nCalculating the nominal concrete cover is an important step in the design of reinforced concrete structures.\\\n"
    "The nominal concrete cover is the minimum thickness of concrete that separates the reinforcement steel from the environment in order to protect the steel from corrosion and to ensure the durability of the structure.\\\n"
    "\\\nThis application provides a simple way to calculate the nominal concrete cover."

EUROCODES = (
    "## Eurocode\nThe calculations adhere to Eurocode 2: Design of concrete structures:\\\nNEN-EN 1992-1-1:2005+A1:2015+NB:2016+A1:2020 (NL) - General rules and rules for buildings "

LIMITATIONS = (
    "## Limitations\n"
    "The durability and cover checks adhere only to the Eurocode and not the ROK. ROK considerations with regard to concrete cover can be mimicked by adjusting the $\Delta c_{dev}$."

BLUEPRINTS = (
    "This application is built using [**Blueprints**](https://blueprints.readthedocs.io/); The open-source Python package for civil engineering calculations.\\\n"
    "You can use Blueprints to write your own python scripts for civil engineering calculations as shown in this [example](https://blueprints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/nominal_concrete_cover/)."
